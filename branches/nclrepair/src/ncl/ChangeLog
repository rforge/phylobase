ChangeLog for NCL 2.1.02
================================================================================
2.1.02 (relative to 2.1.00)
================================================================================
minor bug fixes and const correctness 

================================================================================
Since 2.1-specific changes.
================================================================================
Support for multiple instances of the same block type
	* NxsBlockFactory mechanism API - see the examples/normalizer for an 
		example of usage. Full adoption of these API's is not required, but may
		make your life easier.
	* Reader now stores "implied blocks" -- e.g. makes a DATA block look to the
		client code like a TAXA block and CHARACTERS block. This improves the
		abstraction for library users.

Other features added:
	* commas tolerated in multiple state lists in the cells of a matrix {A,G}
		the same as {AG}.  Such files are not legal, but are common.
	* handling for TITLE and BLOCKID commands added to NxsBlock
	* optimizations (tokenizing and data structures in taxa block) -- now 50
		fold faster than 2.0 on the 11361 Taxon, 1360 Character file in the 
		CIPRES test files.
	* TaxPartition and TreePartition read
	* SETS and CODONS blocks now read. Actually read as a big, fat ASSUMPTIONS
		block that spawns implied blocks (to deal with common practice of mixing 
		the commands in these blocks).
	* WtSet, UserType, and TypeSet command
	* now tolerating DATATYPE not being first in FORMAT command (to deal with
		Clustal exports)
	* tokenizer now skipping embedded comments (note that this changes the
		behavior of command comment storing -- they are only returned if they 
		precede token)
	* support for DATATYPE=MIXED added in CHARACTERS block
	* trees block can now validates trees as they are read to improve error
		reporting  -- this feature not used unless TreesBlock::
		SetProcessAllTreesDuringParse(true) is called on the trees block 
		instance.
	* some support for NHX parsing -- in the TreesDescription.
	* support for LINK command (as introduced by Mesquite)
	* support Mesquite-style CharSet/TaxSet syntax.
 	* NCL_MAJOR_VERSION and  NCL_MINOR_VERSION defines added. You can wrap any 
 		ncl-2.1 specific code (you shouldn't need much) as follows:

================================================================================
#	if defined(NCL_MAJOR_VERSION) && (NCL_MAJOR_VERSION >= 2) && (NCL_MINOR_VERSION >= 1)
		trees->SetAllowImplicitNames(true);
#	endif
================================================================================



bug fixes:
	* RNA equates bug reported by DZ
	* case of equate keys  (characters of both cases are now added for molecular
		data) reported by DZ
	* Tax and Charset reading now tolerate Standard keywords (they still
		generate errors for VECTOR)
	* fixes to the Distances block if the input order is not identical to the
		taxa block order
	* Some CharSet reading 
	* Lots more that I forgot to document.

Behavior changes (could be called features or bugs depending on your POV):
	* Now converts any built in CHARACTERS datatype that has symbols extensions
		to standard datatype.



================================================================================
Since 2.0.0

	* new features: Basic handling of Continuous datatype (ITEMS now

		accepted

30 Nov 2007 Mark Holder (mholder@users.sourceforge.net)
	* Paul's unaligned parsing block functionality added

Version 2.0.01 while suppressing errors)
		- improvements to regression testing

03 Nov 2006 Mark Holder (mholder@users.sourceforge.net)
	* Version 2.0.01
		- minor reorganization (examples dir)
