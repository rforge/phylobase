<h1><a name="top">Nexus Class Library (version 2.1)</a></h1>
<h3>by Paul O. Lewis and Mark Holder</h3>
<p>The NEXUS Class Library is a C++ library for parsing NEXUS files.  Paul Lewis
originally wrote the library and did a very nice job of documenting its interface.
That is the version 2.0 that is documented <a href="v2.0index.html">here</a>.
</p>
<p>Mark Holder has extended NCL and currently does most of the maintenance work.
Version 2.1 strives to be backward compatible with v2.0.
The features that are specific to version 2.1 are not very well documented, but we are
working on documentation <a href="v2.1/index.html">here</a>
