<h1><a name="top">Nexus Class Library (version 2.1)</a></h1>
<h3>by Paul O. Lewis and Mark Holder</h3>
<p>The NEXUS Class Library is a C++ library for parsing NEXUS files.  Paul Lewis
originally wrote the library and did a very nice job of documenting its interface.
That is the version 2.0 that is documented at <a href="http://hydrodictyon.eeb.uconn.edu/ncl/">http://hydrodictyon.eeb.uconn.edu/ncl/</a>.
</p>
<p>Mark Holder has extended NCL and currently does most of the maintenance work.
Version 2.1 strives to be backward compatible with v2.0.
The documentation for v2.1-specific features is not as good as v2.0 docs, but we are
working on them.
They improved a great deal on March 27, 2010.
Those docs are posted at <a href="http://phylo.bio.ku.edu/ncldocs/v2.1/funcdocs/index.html">http://phylo.bio.ku.edu/ncldocs/v2.1/funcdocs/index.html</a>.
They refer to some functions that were just added, so you'll need the latest version of NCL.
