<h2><a class="anchor" id="performance">
Is NCL efficient (time and memory) enough to handle large datasets?</a></h2>
<p>The short answer is "Yes."</p>
<p>Of course, the running time depends on exactly how big the dataset is. NCL's character matrix parsing speed is about as fast as PAUP*'s parsing (and we NCL writers are very proud of that), and its tree reading is slower that PAUP's but not terribly slow.</p>
<p>v2.1 and later are much more efficient than previous versions. On a 2.6GHz i386 MacBook (with 4GB of RAM), Mark Holder obtained the following benchmark results for parsing a file (with comparisons to previous versions of NCL and PAUP* for reference): </p>
<ul>
<li>4.4 seconds for a file with 262,144 taxa (about 90x faster than previous NCL versions. NCL v2.1 parses taxa-only files faster than PAUP on this machine) </li>
<li>3.3 seconds for a file with 16 taxa and just over 1 million DNA sites (about 40x faster than earlier versions, and slightly faster than PAUP). </li>
<li>12.8 seconds for a file with 4,096 taxa and 16,384 characters (once again about 40x faster than earlier versions, and slightly faster than PAUP). </li>
<li>7.9 seconds and 17.8 seconds for a files with 512 taxa and 4,096 trees. The first file had no branch lengths, and the second did have branch lengths (roughly 10-20x speedup compared to previous NCL versions, but 5-10x slower than PAUP*).</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="rockinErrorMessages">
Why are the error messages that  NCL generates because of invalid files so crystal-clear and helpful?</a></h2>
<p>Because NCL rocks!</p>
<p>Seriously, we do try hard to make the error messages helpful and have them accurately describe where the error occurs. This is definitely a strength of the library, and we strive to maintain it. Please let us know if you find a file that generates cryptic/unhelpful error messages (Also see <a class="el" href="FAQ.html#crypticErrorMessages">Why do the error messages that NCL generates because of invalid files have the wrong column number?</a>)</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="crypticErrorMessages">
Why do the error messages that  NCL generates because of invalid files have the wrong column number?</a></h2>
<p>So despite our generally rockin' error messages, there are some warts. It is tough to get accurate column numbers for errors. We try to support reporting of column numbers of errors because extremely long lines are common in TREES and CHARACTERS blocks. Let us know if you find misleading column numbers (check tab characters, first; NCL counts characters since the last newline. A tabstops are assumed to be set to 4, but this is admittedly arbitrary.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="whyNxsString">
Why is there a special NxsString class?</a></h2>
<p>Short answer: convenient appending to strings (including overloads of the "put
to" operator).</p>
<p>It is usually considered unsafe to derive from a class (such as std::string) that lacks a virtual destructor. <a class="el" href="classNxsString.html" title="A string class for use with the Nexus Class Library.">NxsString</a> does not have any additional data members that std::string does not, so we have gotten away with it. It is too late to reverse the decision to bundle a new string class. It is probably best to avoid using it when you don't have to.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="whyNxsStringArg">
Why do some methods take/return a NxsString while others take a std::string ?</a></h2>
<p>At one point we were going to abandon the use of <a class="el" href="classNxsString.html" title="A string class for use with the Nexus Class Library.">NxsString</a>, so newer functions take and return std::string objects. But we <b>really</b> don't want to break old code, so we are not going to complete the migration away from <a class="el" href="classNxsString.html" title="A string class for use with the Nexus Class Library.">NxsString</a> just for the sake of consistency of the API.</p>
<p>Sorry about that, we realize that it makes the library harder to use for newer users.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="whyNoNamespaces">
Why don't you use namespaces instead of the Nxs prefix?</a></h2>
<p>No good reason - history and backwards compatibility</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="whyDumpStdNamespace">
Why does NCL include use the "using namespace std;" statement? I don't want all definitions from std in my namespace!</a></h2>
<p>It is only the convenience header <a class="el" href="ncl_8h_source.html">ncl.h</a> that does this. Either do not include this file (and simply include the headers of the parts of ncl that you do use), or define a preprocessor macro NCL_AVOID_USING_STD to keep the contents of the std namespace from being "dumped" into your code's namespace.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="whyNotConst">
Why aren't all of the functions/variables that could be declared as "const" actually declared to be "const"?</a></h2>
<p>No good reason - history and backwards compatibility</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="whatisNCL_COULD_BE_CONST">
What is NCL_COULD_BE_CONST all about?</a></h2>
<p>We were trying to declare functions that should be const, but that would break old code. So if you compile NCL without any special preprocessor directives, then NCL_COULD_BE_CONST will be converted to an empty string. But if you compile with the NCL_CONST_FUNCS preprocessor flag defined(-DNCL_CONST_FUNCS for most compilers), then NCL_COULD_BE_CONST will be replaced with the word const.</p>
<p>In short if you want const-correctness checking, make sure that NCL_CONST_FUNCS is defined when you build NCL (the --with-constfuncs argument to configure will do this ), and that NCL_CONST_FUNCS is defined when you build your application.</p>
<p>If you are not obsessive compulsive, don't worry about out it.</p>
<p>Yes, we know that some more functions should be decorated with NCL_COULD_BE_CONST to improve const checking (and yes, it bugs us).</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="mixedDatypeSupport">
Does NCL support MrBayes' datatype=mixed extension?</a></h2>
<p>Yes. See <a class="el" href="Gotchas.html#mixedDatatypes">Dealing with Datatype=Mixed</a> discussion.</p>
